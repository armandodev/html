# HTML Repository

Welcome to the **html** repository! This repository is a compilation of various web development projects with a primary emphasis on Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Each project is systematically organized within the "projects" directory, following a standardized naming convention for clarity and seamless exploration.

## Project Structure

Within the "projects" directory, you'll discover distinct web development projects, each identified by a two-digit number followed by the project name. Here's an example to illustrate the structure:

```
/projects
  /00-project-name1
  /01-project-name2
  /02-project-name3
  ...
```

Feel free to explore each project to delve into specific aspects of HTML and web development.

> Learn you how to create your first web-page with HTML.

**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[1] Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
