# HTML Repository

Welcome to the **html** repository! This repository is a compilation of various web development projects with a primary emphasis on Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Each project is systematically organized within the "projects" directory, following a standardized naming convention for clarity and seamless exploration.

## Project Structure

Within the "projects" directory, you'll discover distinct web development projects, each identified by a two-digit number followed by the project name. Here's an example to illustrate the structure:

```
/projects
  /00-project-name1
  /01-project-name2
  /02-project-name3
  ...
```

Feel free to explore each project to delve into specific aspects of HTML and web development.
